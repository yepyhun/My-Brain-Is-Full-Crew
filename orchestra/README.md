# Orchestra

Named scripts that wrap common agent operations into single, permission-friendly commands.

## Why

Claude Code prompts the user for permission on every novel Bash command. When agents run inline pipelines (e.g., `hey box imbox --json | python3 -c "..."`) each unique pipeline triggers a prompt. Named scripts at known paths can be added to the permission allowlist once and run silently forever.

## Installation

The installer (`scripts/launchme.sh`) copies these to `Meta/scripts/` inside your vault. They derive their vault path from their own location, so no configuration is needed.

After installation, add the orchestra scripts to your agentic platform's permission allowlist. E.g. in `~/.claude/settings.json`, merge these entries into the `permissions.allow` array:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(Meta/scripts/hey-imbox:*)",
      "Bash(Meta/scripts/hey-feed:*)",
      "Bash(Meta/scripts/hey-trail:*)",
      "Bash(Meta/scripts/hey-later:*)",
      "Bash(Meta/scripts/hey-thread:*)",
      "Bash(Meta/scripts/hey-seen:*)",
      "Bash(Meta/scripts/hey-check:*)",
      "Bash(Meta/scripts/tracker-today:*)",
      "Bash(Meta/scripts/tracker-recent:*)",
      "Bash(Meta/scripts/tracker-search:*)",
      "Bash(Meta/scripts/tracker-mailbox:*)",
      "Bash(Meta/scripts/vault-stats:*)",
      "Bash(Meta/scripts/vault-inbox:*)",
      "Bash(Meta/scripts/contact-lookup:*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

> If you already have a `permissions.allow` array, add the entries to it rather than replacing it.

## Scripts

### Hey Mailbox Scripts

These wrap `hey` CLI commands into table-formatted output.

| Script | Usage | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `hey-imbox` | `hey-imbox [--json]` | List Imbox (screened-in, high priority) |
| `hey-feed` | `hey-feed [--json]` | List Feed (newsletters, notifications) |
| `hey-trail` | `hey-trail [--json]` | List Paper Trail (receipts, financial) |
| `hey-later` | `hey-later [--json]` | List Reply Later / Set Aside |
| `hey-thread` | `hey-thread <id>` | Read a specific thread by posting ID |
| `hey-seen` | `hey-seen <id>` | Mark a posting as seen |

### Tracker Scripts

These query the local `Meta/hey-tracker.jsonl` file. No API calls, instant results, full history.

The tracker is populated by a cron job running `hey-poll.sh` (see the Hey poller setup docs).

| Script | Usage | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `hey-check` | `hey-check [days] [--search query] [--all]` | General tracker query (default: last 2 days) |
| `tracker-today` | `tracker-today [--mailbox box] [--json]` | Today's entries only |
| `tracker-recent` | `tracker-recent [hours] [--mailbox box] [--json]` | Last N hours (default 24) |
| `tracker-search` | `tracker-search <query> [--mailbox box] [--json]` | Full-text search across all history |
| `tracker-mailbox` | `tracker-mailbox <box> [days] [--json]` | Filter by mailbox + time window |
| `contact-lookup` | `contact-lookup <name>` | All emails from/to a specific person |

### Vault Scripts

| Script | Usage | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `vault-stats` | `vault-stats` | Note counts by folder, recent activity |
| `vault-inbox` | `vault-inbox [--count]` | List inbox notes (or just count them) |

## Requirements

- **Hey scripts**: require `hey` CLI installed and authenticated
- **Tracker scripts**: require `Meta/hey-tracker.jsonl` to exist (populated by the Hey poller cron job)
- **Vault scripts**: work with any vault, no dependencies
- All scripts require Python 3 (available by default on macOS)

## Path Resolution

Scripts derive the vault root from their own location. They expect to be installed at `Meta/scripts/` inside the vault:

```
your-vault/
  Meta/
    scripts/        <-- scripts live here
      hey-imbox
      tracker-today
      ...
    hey-tracker.jsonl
  00-Inbox/
  01-Projects/
  ...
```
