# Agent Registry

This file is the **single source of truth** for all active agents in the crew. The dispatcher (`CLAUDE.md`) and all agents reference this file for routing decisions and inter-agent coordination.

The registry is designed to grow: custom agents (see Issue #12) are added as new rows following the same schema.

## Status Values

- **active**: Agent is operational and available for dispatch
- **disabled**: Agent is temporarily disabled — the dispatcher will skip it

---

## How This File Is Used

1. **Dispatcher** reads the `Input` column to match user messages to agents
2. **Dispatcher** reads `Output` + `Capabilities` of other agents to decide if chaining is needed after an agent returns
3. **Agents** reference this file when suggesting next agents in their output
4. **Custom agents** are added as new rows by the Architect during the custom agent creation flow

---

## Custom Agents

Custom agents are created by the Architect through a conversational flow with the user. They follow the exact same schema as core agents and are added as new rows in the Registry table above.

### How Custom Agents Are Added

1. The user asks the Architect to create a new agent (or an existing agent suggests one via `### Suggested new agent`)
2. The Architect conducts a detailed conversation to understand requirements
3. The Architect generates the agent file in `.claude/agents/`, adds a row to the Registry table above, and updates `agents.md`
4. The platform auto-discovers the new agent from its frontmatter

### Naming Rules

- Custom agent names must be lowercase, hyphens only (e.g., `habit-tracker`, `recipe-manager`)
- Names must NOT conflict with core agent names: architect, scribe, sorter, seeker, connector, librarian, transcriber, postman
- Names should be descriptive and concise (1-2 words)

### Priority

Custom agents always have lower routing priority than the 8 core agents. The dispatcher checks custom agents only when no core agent matches the user's message. Among custom agents, the dispatcher uses the Input column to find the best match

---

## Skills Registry

Skills handle complex, multi-step workflows extracted from agents. They are checked **before** agents by the dispatcher (higher priority). Skills run in the main conversation context via the Skill tool, preserving multi-turn state.

| `/inbox-triage` | sorter | "triage the inbox", "clean up the inbox", "sort my notes", "empty inbox", "file my notes", "process the inbox" | Inbox note processing, classification, and routing | active |

### How Skills Are Routed

1. The dispatcher checks the **skill routing table** (in `CLAUDE.md`) before the agent routing table
2. If a trigger matches, the skill is invoked via the **Skill tool** — not the Agent tool
3. If no skill matches, the dispatcher falls through to agent routing
4. Skills can produce `### Suggested next agent` output, which the dispatcher handles using the same chaining rules as agents
